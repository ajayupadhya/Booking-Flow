## Getting Started

Project is built on next js, to run a project

first, install dependencies by running - npm install or yarn
then to start the project - npm run dev or yarn dev
The project is hosted on port (http://localhost:3000)


And deployed on vercel - https://booking-flow-ochre.vercel.app/


this project uses momentjs for date formatting and making custom calendar, react-redux for state management, and no other external libraries
Media Query is used for responsive design

The biggest challenge was making a calendar from scratch. It has some bugs will fix it soon
